## AI Cancer Care (BeatCancer: AI Assistant to Craft Personalized Cancer Care)

Welcome to the AI Cancer Care project, a revolutionary AI assistant designed to provide personalized cancer care by analyzing patient data, guidelines, and medical records. Our goal is to identify screening gaps and create tailored treatment plans to improve patient outcomes.

### Key Features

1. **Personalized Treatment Plans**

   - Analyzes patient data, medical records, and guidelines.
   - Identifies gaps in cancer screening and follow-up care.
   - Crafts tailored treatment plans for individual patients.

2. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**

   - Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to verify patient data or trial results without revealing the actual data.
   - Ensures patient privacy and data security during verification processes.

3. **Secure Data Sharing**
   - Shares sensitive data securely using StarkNet’s encryption and cryptographic features.
   - Protects patient information while facilitating necessary data access for healthcare providers.

### Problem Statement

Patients often need to consult multiple specialists and healthcare providers, making it challenging to keep track of their treatment plans and screening schedules. This situation can lead to missed screenings, delayed diagnoses, and suboptimal treatment outcomes.

One of our users shared their experience: _"This is great news. My wife is battling cancer now. We’ve spent hours of manual research to try to get ahead of it. Another good medical idea: Load all of your lab results in and let AI recommend treatment plans. Even for non-cancer."_

### Solution

Our AI assistant addresses these challenges by:

- Automating the analysis of medical records and patient data.
- Providing clear, personalized treatment recommendations.
- Highlighting any missed screenings or necessary follow-up actions.
- Leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques to maintain patient privacy and data security.

### IPFS Integration

We utilize IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store and share medical records securely and efficiently. This ensures data integrity and availability, enabling seamless access to patient records by authorized healthcare providers.

### How to Use

1. **Upload Reports**

   - Patients or healthcare providers can upload medical reports directly into the system.

2. **View Treatment Plan**

   - The AI assistant generates a detailed treatment plan based on the uploaded data and identified gaps.

3. **Track Progress**
   - Patients can monitor their progress, completed screenings, and upcoming appointments through a user-friendly dashboard.

### Dashboard and User Interface

Our user interface is designed to provide a comprehensive view of the patient's treatment journey. Key features include:

- **Specialist Appointments Pending**
  - Displays pending appointments with specialists that need attention.
- **Treatment Progress Update**

  - Shows the number of specialist visits completed and overall treatment progress.

- **Metrics and Analytics**
  - Provides insights into total folders, screenings, completed screenings, pending screenings, and overdue screenings.
